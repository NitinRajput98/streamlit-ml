# Mushrooms web app deployed on Heroku
Built an interactive web application with Streamlit and Python which allows the users to choose which classification algorithm
(Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Classifiers)
they want to use and let them interactively set hyper-parameter values, all without them knowing to code!
Also plotting evaluation metrics for the binary classification algorithms.
